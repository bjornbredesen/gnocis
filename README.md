# Gnocis
Bjørn Bredesen, 2018-


----------------------------------------------------------------------

## About

Gnocis is a system in Python 3 for the analysis and the modelling of *cis*-regulatory element DNA sequences. A broad suite of tools is implemented for data preparation, feature set definition, model training and prediction.


----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Installing

To install via the PyPI package manager, open a terminal and execute

`pip install gnocis`


To build, run

`make all`


To install, run

`pip install .`


-------------------------------------------------

## Using

See the `tutorial/` folder for an in-depth tutorial in using Gnocis.
